Bring balance to stashes.

Sets the distance at which players must build from stashes. No more hiding stashes inside of buildings or deployables. If you disabled stashes for this reason then fret no more.

**Hit a stash with a hammer to see the contents inside.**

Changes apply each time the plugin is loaded, and when new stashes are placed.

## Chat Commands
Also available for admins only:
- **/sg** -- show all stashes within 500m with optional contents in the stash.
